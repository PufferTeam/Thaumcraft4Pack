## Install Client
### Client Instance: [Download](https://github.com/PufferTeam/Thaumcraft4Pack/raw/refs/heads/dev/Thaumcraft4Pack.zip)

You need either [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org/) or [PolyMC](https://polymc.org/) to be able to run this modpack without any issues. So make sure you are using either of those.

After downloading the MMC Instance .zip you can simply import from zip with the file you just downloaded.
## Install Server
### Server Files: [Download](https://github.com/PufferTeam/Thaumcraft4Pack/raw/refs/heads/dev/Thaumcraft4Pack-Server.zip)
For the moment this is mainly done to works with Windows, so for Linux this won't works. But I will make a linux script once I can.

After downloading the server files .zip, extract it and put the folder wherever you want to host your server.

You can now run the server-start.bat file and just wait, after the files being downloaded your server should be opening and ready to play. To allow other people to join you need to port-foward the TCP port 25565, or use [playit.gg](http://playit.gg/) to do the same thing if you can't port-forward.

Every time you want to launch your server click on that same server-start.bat.
